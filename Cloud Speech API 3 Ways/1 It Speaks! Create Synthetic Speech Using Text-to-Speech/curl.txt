1. The following curl command gets the list of all the voices you can select from when creating synthetic speech using the Text-to-Speech API:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer "$(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token) \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
    "https://texttospeech.googleapis.com/v1/voices"

2. To scope the results returned from the API to just a single language code, run:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer "$(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token) \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
    "https://texttospeech.googleapis.com/v1/voices?language_code=en"

3. Use the following code to call the Text-to-Speech API using the curl command:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer "$(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token) \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
  -d @synthesize-text.json "https://texttospeech.googleapis.com/v1/text:synthesize" \
  > synthesize-text.txt

4. In Cloud Shell use the following code to call the Text-to-Speech API, which saves the output to a file called synthesize-ssml.txt:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer "$(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token) \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
  -d @synthesize-ssml.json "https://texttospeech.googleapis.com/v1/text:synthesize" \
  > synthesize-ssml.txt

5. Use the following code to call the Text-to-Speech API using the curl command:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer "$(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token) \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
  -d @synthesize-with-settings.json "https://texttospeech.googleapis.com/v1beta1/text:synthesize" \
  > synthesize-with-settings.txt
